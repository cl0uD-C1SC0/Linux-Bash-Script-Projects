# Script Naming Convention

* Scripts directory
* Script name should identify function (e.g. Script check the date, the name of script should be date.sh)
* Script should end with .shell (if multiple shells are used)
To view your shell execute: echo $0

# Script file Permissions

* All scripts to be executed should have proper executable file permissions (e.g rwXr-Xr-X)
* To change permissions (chmod a+x script-name)

# Script Format

* Define Shell (#!/bin/bash)
* Comments (# comments)
* Definen Variables (e.g name=Imran)
* Commands (echo, cp, grep etc.)
* Statements (if, while, for etc.)
